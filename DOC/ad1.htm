Netscape plug-ins extend Netscape Navigator to include a wide range of
interactive and multimedia capabilities.  Plug-ins are software modules that
are seamlessly integrated into Navigator, appearing simply as supplemental
capabilities.  By accessing and implementing plug-ins, Netscape Navigator
becomes your platform for the Internet.  
<P>
Plug-ins offer a rich variety of functions and features to enhance and increase
the functionality and compatibility of Navigator. Plug-ins have been used as:
<UL>
<LI>Multimedia Viewers, such as Live3D, Macromedia Shockwave, and
Adobe Acrobat
<LI>Utilities, such as object embedding and compression/decompression
<LI>Applications, such as personal information managers and games
</UL>
The utilization of plug-in technology is constantly expanding beyond current
applications, as demonstrated by the growing <A
HREF="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_2.0/plugins/plugin_developers.html">list
of independent software vendors who are creating new and innovative
plug-ins</A>.
<P>
Plug-ins can be installed by running a setup program supplied with the
plug-in.  Plug-ins reside on the local hard drive and are detected by Navigator
when it starts up.  When Navigator encounters data handled by a plug-in (either
embedded in an HTML page or in a separate file), it loads the appropriate plug-in
and gives it access to all or a part of a window. The plug-in remains active until
the associated page or file is closed.
