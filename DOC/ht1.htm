Creating a Navigator plug-in is a two-step process. First, you
download and decompress the sample source code. Then, you make the
necessary changes and write the required code in the files provided.
Finally, you test your plug-in by creating an HTML document.
<P>
Once you have completed the implementation of your plug-in, you can
test it by creating an HTML document and <A HREF="pr2.htm">embedding the plug-in object</A>.  
Then to load the plug-in, simply display the page in Navigator. 
<P>
This SDK includes complete step-by-step instructions for creating a

platform you are working on, make sure to follow the steps for the
appropriate environment.
