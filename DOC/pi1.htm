Netscape Plug-ins communicate with Navigator via an Application Programming Interface
(API).  Two types of functions make up the Plug-in API: plug-in methods and Netscape
methods.  Plug-in methods are functions that you implement in your plug-in and are called
by Netscape; Netscape methods are functions implemented by Netscape that your plug-in may
call.  For clarity, the names of all plug-in functions begin with "NPP_", while all
Netscape functions begin with "NPN_".
<P>
In general, all API functions operate identically on all platforms.  However, there are
several functions, notably <tt>NPP_HandleEvent</tt> and <tt>NPN_MemFlush</tt>, whose
operation is platform-specific.  All platform-specific differences are described in the
documentation for the individual functions.
<P>
Unless otherwise stated, ownership for all API function parameters remains with the caller
and values are valid only for the duration of each call.  For example, if Netscape passes
your plug-in a string, your plug-in should make its own copy of the string if you need to
reference the string after returning from that function.  If you pass Netscape a string or
buffer, you are responsible for freeing the memory allocated for the data; Netscape will
make its own private copy of the data if necessary.
<P>
Declarations for all API functions as well as definitions of all types and structures used
in the API functions are found in the file <tt>npapi.h</tt>.  Since most functions return
an error value of type <tt>NPError</tt>, definitions for error code values are included in
<tt>npapi.h</tt> as well.
<P>
The plug-in API is organized by type of method. Within each section, the functions are
listed alphabetically.
