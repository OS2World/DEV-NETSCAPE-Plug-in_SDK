<P>
Plug-ins are dynamic code modules that are associated with one or more MIME types.
When Netscape Navigator starts, it enumerates the available plug-ins in a platform-specific
manner, reads one or more string resources out of each plug-in file to determine the MIME
types for that plug-in, and registers each plug-in for its MIME types.
<P>
When Navigator encounters data of a MIME type registered for a plug-in (either embedded in an
HTML page or in a separate file), it loads the plug-in code into memory (if it hasn't been
loaded already) and creates a new <I>instance</I> of the plug-in.  Netscape calls the plug-in
API function <A HREF="pi2.htm#nppinitialize">NPP_Initialize</A> when the plug-in code is
first loaded, and the function <A HREF="pi2.htm#nppnew">NPP_New</A> when the instance is
created.  There may be multiple instances of the same plug-in if there are multiple embedded
objects on a single page, or if several Netscape windows are open with each displaying
the same data type.
<P>
A plug-in instance is deleted when a user leaves the instance's page or
closes the instance's window; Netscape will call the function
<A HREF="pi2.htm#nppdestroy">NPP_Destroy</A> to inform the plug-in that the instance is
being deleted.
When the last instance of a plug-in is deleted, the plug-in
code is unloaded from memory and Netscape calls the function
<A HREF="pi2.htm#nppshutdown">NPP_Shutdown</A>.
Plug-ins consume no resources (other than disk space) if not referenced.
